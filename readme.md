### Slack
Link - https://slack.com/

Make sure students have a Slack account, and recommend they download the Slack app on their computers and phones, so they don't miss any announcements. Make sure students have joined the cohort slack channel as well as the `web`, `lehi-shuttle`, `lehi-campus`, and `jobs` channels.

### Git/Git-bash
MacOS - https://git-scm.com/downloads

Windows - https://gitforwindows.org/

### GitHub
Link - https://www.github.com

Make sure students have a GitHub account. This is also a good time to configure the username, email, and password of GitHub to work with Git that was just installed.

### Node/NPM
Link - https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Students should install the LTS version of Node, and then double check it's been installed in the terminal.

### VSCode
Link - https://code.visualstudio.com/download

Once students have installed VSCode, have students (those with Mac), move the application out of the downloads folder and into the applications folder. 

Students with MacOS will need to install the code command. This is done by typing `command, shift, p` to open the search bar. Type `shell command` and have students select the first option.

Show students how to open the terminal in VSCode, and have them check if their terminal is running on `Bash`. If it's running on `Powershell` instead, have the students change the default terminal shell by typing `command, shift, p` or `ctrl, shift, p` to open the search bar. Once the search bar is opened, have the students type `select default shell`. They will be able to select Bash as an option.

### Repl.it
Link - https://repl.it/

Students should have a repl.it account, and if they don't, have them sign up for one. This is particularly important for the JavaScript lecture days.

### Canvas
Link - https://lms.devmountain.com/login/canvas

Introduce students to the LMS and how to navigate it. If students are unable to access the LMS, make sure they are added and recieve the email to sign in. All students need to be able to access the LMS by the end of day one to avoid them falling behind.

### The Q
Link - http://q.devmountain.com

Introduce the Q to students, and explain expectations for using the Q. It's generally a good idea to recommend the students bookmark the Q so they have it easily accessible.
